Data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington has been explored using python.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are there for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
